This is my first completed game, I wanted to learn the Libgdx game framework and make games for Android so I used this project as a way to learn the framework. All the code is written in Java and borrows from some design principles such as MVC and the Observer Pattern. This was the largest project I have completed from scratch and it was a very enjoyable experience, had many hours of frustration trying to get things to work and make images show up properly.

The game itself is simple, it is an endless survivor game. The controls maybe hard to get used to at first, I tried all types from using a virtual d pad to using an accelerometer, and found the best is to use a dpad combined with drag events. You can basically touch and drag in the direction you want to move, and you can start the touch anywhere. Its almost like a joystick but very sensitive, takes time to master!

Took some sounds and music from http://opengameart.org/users/kenney, highly recommend this website for its free resources.
